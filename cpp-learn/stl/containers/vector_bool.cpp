/**
 * The vector<bool> from <vector> is a specialization of vector (ยง31.4) providing
 * compact storage of bits (bool).
 *
 * The similarity to bitset_ is obvious, but, unlike bitset_ but like vector<T>,
 * vector<bool> has an allocator and can have its size changed.
 *
 * As in a vector<T>, elements of a vector<bool> with higher indices have higher addresses:
 * position:        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 * vector<bool>:    1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1
 *
 * Use vector<bool> as you would any other vector<T>, but expect operations on a single
 * bit to be less efficient than the equivalent operations on a vector<char>.
