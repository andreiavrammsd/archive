/**
 * The Garbage Collection Interface
 *
 * I see garbage collection as a convenient last resort after the usual techniques for preventing leaks
 * have been exhausted:
 *
 * [1] Use resource handles with the proper semantics for an application whenever possible.
 * The standard library provides string, vector,unordered_map, thread, lock_guard, and more.
 * Move semantics allow such objects to be efficiently returned from a function.
 *
 * [2] Use unique_ptrs to hold on to objects that do not implicitly manage their own resources
 * (such as pointers), need to be protected from premature deletion (because they don't have
 * proper destructors), or need to be allocated in ways that require special attention (deleters).
 *
 * [3] Use shared_ptrs to hold objects that require shared ownership.
 *
 * A garbage collector is not even a required part of a standard C++ implementation.

     * C++ garbage collectors have traditionally been conservative collectors; that is, they do not move
     * objects around in memory and have to assume that every word in memory might contain a pointer.
     * Conservative garbage collection is more efficient than it is reputed to be, especially when a program
     * doesn't generate much garbage, but declare_no_pointers() can make it very efficient by safely
     * eliminating large parts of memory from consideration. For example, we might use declare_no_pointers()
     * to tell the collector where our photographic images are in an application, so as to allow the collector
     * to ignore potentially gigabytes of non-pointer data.
     *
     * A programmer can inquire which rules for pointer safety and reclamation are in force:
